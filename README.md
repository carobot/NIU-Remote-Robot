# NIU-Remote-Robot

1. Use Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO Extension
2. To compile the each project, open the project folder and use "Build", "Run", etc. from bottom bar
    - ignore "include" error in the editor as it doesn't look with the Arduino path
3. Check USB or programmer connection or configuration if code is not uploading properly
