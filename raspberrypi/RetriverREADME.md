The retriever.py program is run on the raspberry pi. It interfaces with the database, and conveys information to the Arduino. Additionally, the program streams the USB cameras to the internet. 

The program receives snapshots of the information stored in the database through the reference.get() line of the firebase_admin library. In order to make sure that commands are not repeated, the program stores the states of the database. By comparing the stored values to new snapshots, the program detects if a change has occurred. If a change occurred, the program sends a byte array through the serial port to the Arduino. The array contains 3 bytes. The first being the start of text ASCII code (0x02 in hex) followed by the data (w,a,s, or d for the direction and q for shoot), followed by the end of text ASCII code (0x03 in hex). 

The streaming is slightly unrefined, in that it streams to Youtube. Youtube is not the most optimal streaming service since it has very high latency. Other services are significantly faster, the fastest being hosting an nginx streaming server and receiving the stream without a mediary service. 

In order for the program to send a stream, the webcam stream must be encoded into RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol). The raspberry pi uses the ffmpeg program to encode the stream and send it to the url. This is done by using the OS.system() lines to kill all processes which are running ffmpeg already, followed by subprocess.Popen([“ffmpeg -f v4l2…..”], shell=True) to run a terminal command that begins the encoding and streaming. It is vital to use a subprocess here since it allows the stream to run in parallel instead of stopping the rest of the program.
